# EmailBot
This one is going to be difficult for me. I have so many emails that I have to check and send out. This is a fun project that I want do to learn more about Python and different libraries used to make this. The purpose of this project is to create an AI that can send an email. This project is mostly for educational purposes.


# Libraries to install
```
pip smtplib 
pip speech_recognition as sr
pip pyttsx3
```
# Important Notes Regarding pip speech_recognition
I know a few people are goign to have probelms installing the speech_recognition server into their terminal. What worked for me is using anaconda and installing speech recognition from the conda terminal. Then open up the anaconda navigator typing anaconda-navifgator in the conmda terminal and lauching your code editor from there. If you don't have anaconda, install it first and follow these instructions to get speech_recognition to work on your AI.
